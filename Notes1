#1 REST API (Representational State Transfer API)

-API is basically a set of functions and procedures that allow one application to access the feature of other application
-REST is an architectural style for networked applications on the web. It is limited to client-server based applications

#2 Diff bw Rest API and SOAP API
-REST API: REST is an abstraction of the structure and behavior of the World Wide Web. The goal of REST is to create an
 architectural style that better represents the requirements of the modern web
 REST API has no has no official standard at all because it is an architectural style
 
-SOAP API: SOAP API , on the other hand, has an official standard because it is a protocol. REST APIs uses multiple standards
 like HTTP, JSON, URL, and XML while SOAP APIs is largely based on HTTP and XML
 
 
 #3 if site block web scrapper, place useragent as chrome, opera etc so that website will think request is coming from some web browser
  not from any api or program
  
 #4 to automatic update database abt user recent reviews
 - just use timestamp threshold and put a condition to to refresh it after a cetrain time (eg 3 days)
 
 #5 what if some web pages ask me to sign in before open (for compulsory)
 - just use Post command code , so that sign in requirement will be given automaticallly from our Web API 
 - Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs

 What is BeautifulSoup used for?
 - BeautifulSoup is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It is often used for web scraping
 What does BeautifulSoup return?
 - BeautifulSoup transforms a complex HTML document into a complex tree of Python objects,
   such as tag, navigable string, or comment.
 *Parsing
 =>Parsing means dividing anything into smallest components to understand from the core. In programming parsing means
   breaking a program elements into their smallest units to create some knowledge for a compiler to understand the syntax 


#7flask App: Web Development Framework
- Framework means collections of libraries (Methods/ functions)
- Web Devlopment means internet

#9 Application flow architecture
1. load index.html (as homepage)
2. user searches with keyboards n press submit
3. (Now control will come to) python app - list of reviews
4. send reviews to results.html (using MongoDb)
5. user will see the reviews in result.html 

*** Note all html files are for views and flask_app.py is for flow of control (MVC architecture - model, view control)
*** Note MVC is a good way to achieve this goal in web application architecture. By separating controllers (handling requests
and mapping to business logic), models (implementing business logic), and views (presenting and formatting output), 
it's easier to change code in each of these layers

*** Whatever fun we callled inside route it will be get called eg index

-requirements.txt is a industry standard, so by using command in terminal of pycharm (..) we can give inststructions to
 heroku cloud to install all required libraries related to  neeed of that appp environment.
